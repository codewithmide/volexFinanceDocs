[[{"l":"Overview","p":["Velox Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator built on the Solana blockchain. It leverages zkCompression technology to provide efficient access to compressed tokens, a new and advanced token standard on Solana. With Velox Finance, users can perform all core DeFi functions like minting, swapping, staking, and dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in a streamlined and secure environment.","The platform is designed to optimize the user experience, offering fast transactions, low fees, and deep liquidity for compressed tokens. By utilizing zkCompression, Velox Finance significantly reduces data storage costs on-chain, making it possible for users to interact with compressed tokens in a cost-effective manner. This opens up new possibilities for scaling decentralized applications (dApps) and tokenized assets on Solana.","Velox Finance simplifies DeFi for users while supporting a range of functionalities that make managing compressed assets easy and efficient. Whether you're a trader, investor, or developer, the platform provides all the necessary tools to interact with the compressed token ecosystem. Some of the key features include:","Minting: Create new compressed tokens on Solana while significantly reducing transaction costs and on-chain data usage. zkCompression technology enables users to mint tokens more efficiently than traditional methods.","Swapping: Seamlessly trade compressed tokens through deep liquidity pools. Velox Finance aggregates liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana, ensuring users get the best price with minimal slippage.","DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging): Automate your investment strategy by purchasing compressed tokens at regular intervals. This feature is ideal for reducing the impact of market volatility and building a long-term position in compressed assets without having to manually execute trades.","Staking: Earn passive income by staking your compressed tokens. Users can participate in staking pools to receive rewards, helping secure the network or specific dApps, while potentially contributing to platform governance.","Liquidity Provision: Users can become liquidity providers (LPs) by depositing compressed tokens into liquidity pools. In return, LPs earn a portion of the trading fees generated on Velox Finance. This also allows them to unlock additional farming rewards or governance tokens, depending on the pool's incentives.","Yield Farming: Maximize returns by participating in yield farming programs. Users can stake their liquidity provider tokens (LP tokens) in yield farms to earn high APY on their holdings. The rewards may be in the form of governance tokens, native platform tokens, or other DeFi tokens.","Aggregation of Compressed Token Data: Velox Finance consolidates real-time data from various Solana protocols to offer comprehensive insights into compressed tokens. This includes price charts, market trends, transaction history, and on-chain analytics, helping users make data-driven decisions when trading or staking.","Flash Loans: Velox Finance allows users to access flash loans—instant, uncollateralized loans designed for arbitrage, liquidation, or leveraged positions. Users can execute complex DeFi strategies in a single transaction without the need for upfront capital, provided the borrowed amount is repaid within the same transaction.","Collateralized Borrowing and Lending: Users can collateralize their compressed tokens to borrow stablecoins or other assets. Velox Finance integrates decentralized lending protocols, enabling users to unlock liquidity from their compressed tokens without selling them, thereby maintaining their exposure to the underlying assets.","Governance Participation: Volex Finance is designed to be community-driven. By holding governance tokens, users can propose and vote on protocol upgrades, new features, or changes to fee structures. This decentralized governance model ensures the platform evolves according to the needs of its users.","Portfolio Tracking: Keep track of your compressed token holdings, past trades, staking positions, and yield farming performance in real time. The Velox Finance dashboard provides an intuitive portfolio management tool that consolidates all of your DeFi activities in one place.","Velox Finance is optimized for performance, security, and scalability, allowing users to benefit from the speed and low fees of Solana while accessing the next generation of token technology. Whether you're looking to trade, stake, or build applications on compressed tokens, Velox Finance offers the tools and infrastructure to support your needs."]}],[{"l":"Mint","p":["The Mint Compressed Token page in Volex Finance allows users to create new compressed tokens on the Solana blockchain. Below is a detailed breakdown of the interface and process, based on the image you provided:"]},{"l":"1. Recipient Public Key","p":["This input field requires the public key of the recipient who will receive the newly minted compressed tokens.","Users must ensure that this is a valid public key on Solana to avoid minting tokens to an invalid or unintended address."]},{"i":"2-mint-amount-in-smallest-units","l":"2. Mint Amount (in smallest units)","p":["In this field, the user enters the amount of tokens to mint. The value is entered in the smallest unit of the token (similar to \"lamports\" in Solana).","For example, 2000000000 here represents 2 whole tokens. It’s vital that the user understands this to avoid minting an incorrect amount."]},{"l":"3. Mint Compressed Tokens Button","p":["The Mint Compressed Tokens button initiates the minting process. When clicked, it sends a transaction to the Solana blockchain to mint the specified amount of compressed tokens to the recipient's public key.","The button becomes active when both the recipient public key and mint amount fields are filled correctly."]},{"l":"4. Transaction Information","p":["After a successful minting operation, details of the transaction are displayed for the user to verify:","Mint Address: This is the Solana address where the newly minted tokens have been sent (to the recipient’s public key).","Mint Transaction Signature: Every transaction on Solana generates a unique signature, which acts as proof that the transaction took place on the blockchain. This signature can be used to verify the transaction or check its status on a Solana block explorer.","Transfer Transaction ID: This is the specific transaction ID tied to the minting process. Users can track this transaction using the ID on Compressed Token Solana’s explorer for transparency and verification."]},{"l":"How It Works","p":["Input Public Key and Amount: The user provides the recipient’s public key and the number of tokens to mint.","Initiate Minting: Once the fields are filled in, clicking the \"Mint Compressed Tokens\" button initiates the minting process.","Transaction Completion: After minting, the system will display the mint address, transaction signature, and transaction ID, allowing the user to confirm that the tokens were successfully created and sent to the correct recipient."]},{"l":"Features and Benefits","p":["Easy Token Creation: The UI is simple and user-friendly, allowing anyone to mint compressed tokens without needing deep technical knowledge.","Cost-Effective Minting: By leveraging zkCompression technology, users benefit from reduced transaction costs compared to minting regular tokens on Solana.","Transaction Transparency: All minting transactions are transparent, with easy access to transaction signatures and IDs, enabling users to verify their actions on the blockchain.","Instant Feedback: After the minting process, users receive real-time feedback on the status of their mint, with all relevant transaction details displayed.","In summary, the Mint Compressed Token page on Volex Finance simplifies the process of creating new compressed tokens on Solana.

Slippage Tolerance Settings","p":["Set Slippage: On the top right of the interface, users can manually set their preferred slippage tolerance. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a token and the actual price at the time of the transaction. This occurs due to price changes during high volatility or low liquidity.","Slippage Display: Below the swap fields, the current slippage tolerance is shown as 1%, meaning the user is willing to tolerate a 1% price difference during the swap. Users can adjust this value based on their risk tolerance and market conditions."]},{"l":"6. Balance Display","p":["The page also displays the user’s balance for the selected \"From\" token at the top. If the balance is 0.000000000, that means the user does not have enough tokens to initiate a swap. The system also alerts the user in a red text."]},{"l":"7. Swap Button","p":["The Swap button at the bottom initiates the swap transaction. When clicked, it will prompt the user to confirm the swap based on the current exchange rates, slippage tolerance, and fees.","In the current state, the button is disabled(gray) due to the insufficient balance. The button becomes active once a valid amount of tokens is available for swapping and all the necessary conditions (like slippage) are met."]},{"l":"How It Works","p":["Selecting Tokens: Users select the token they want to swap from (e.g., \"GGM...S4\") and the token they wish to receive.","Input Amount: Users input the desired amount in the \"From\" field. The interface will automatically calculate how much of the \"To\" token will be received based on current market rates.","Adjust Slippage: If the user expects market volatility, they can adjust the slippage tolerance to avoid failed transactions.","Swap Execution: Once everything is set (sufficient balance, selected tokens, slippage), the user can click the \"Swap\" button to confirm the transaction. After confirmation, the swap is processed on the Solana blockchain, and the user receives the new token."]},{"l":"Features and Benefits","p":["Real-Time Price Data: The swap interface pulls in real-time price data from liquidity pools and DEXs on Solana, ensuring users always receive up-to-date rates when trading compressed tokens.","Low Fees and Fast Transactions: Thanks to the underlying zkCompression technology, swapping tokens on Volex Finance is cheaper and faster compared to traditional token exchanges, reducing both on-chain costs and transaction times.","Customizable Slippage Tolerance: Allowing users to customize their slippage tolerance gives them more control over the price they are willing to accept, especially during periods of high market volatility.","User-Friendly Design: The simple, intuitive interface is designed to make token swaps straightforward, even for users new to DeFi or compressed tokens.","In summary, the Swap page on Volex Finance is a powerful tool that lets users trade compressed tokens with minimal friction, ensuring fast transactions, low fees, and a high degree of customization."]}]]
